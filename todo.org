* TODO Replace all `x's with 'x'.
* TODO spell check.
* TODO draw ascii pictures of header format.
* TODO draw ascii pictures of memory layout.
* TODO Correct captialization and punctuation of all comments.
* TODO Make all continued comments indented by three.
* TODO Make sure to mention that i/o to terminal is buffered.
* TODO Reword line comments in strcpy.
* TODO Make all comments for `jsb create' have the same structure.
* TODO Reconcile comments in { string } and { string" }.
  The comment "make high byte of current count" in { string } seems
  similar to the one in { string" } that starts the same, but the one
  in { string } seems to be truncated.  And should the "movw#0,(r9)+
  on the same line be a movb instead, as in { string" }?
* TODO Shouldn't strpos length arguments be shorts?
  In stack comments `n' means longword; it should be `s', since these
  can never be greater than word sized, since the maximum length in a
  string created by { string } or { string" } is a word.  What about
  signed and unsigned?  That's probably unsigned, isn't it?  Have to
  check everywhere that those lengths are used...
* TODO Make all uses of .. and ... indicating ranges consistent.
  I was probably using Pascal syntax for intervals [low..high], but I
  noticed at least one '...', which is wrong, since that's an
  ellipsis.  Sigh.  Use math interval notations instead?  No.  I
  wouldn't have used them then, I probably should change that now.
* TODO Make all the comments on branch statments start with 'go'.
* TODO Make sure all words have stack comments on '>' line.
* TODO Make smudge bit pattern a constant.
* TODO Make sure all references to LFA, PFA, CFA are in uppercase.
* TODO Make sure LFA, PFA, CFA are explained in early comment.
* TODO Make sure '...' is used everywhere inside { }, not '..'.
  Inside { } we're (almost?) always using an ellipsis, not a range.
* TODO Add a constant word pad-moat?
  The definition of pad in VTIL.RNO refers to "(eodp + c_pad_moat)", which 
  would be better as { eodp pad-moat + }.
* TODO Test all the block words and related words
  Like: buffer, buffer-read, buffer-write
