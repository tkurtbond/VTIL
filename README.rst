VTIL - VAX Threaded Interpretive Language
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

My undergrad senior project at the tail end of the 1980s was writing a
Threaded Interpretive Language for VAX/VMS, which I named VTIL.  I
wrote it in VAX MACRO using subroutine threading, and enjoyed the
process immensely.

Eventually I didn't have access to the tape drives necessary to get
the source off tape anymore.  However, recently printouts of the
documentation (the paper I wrote for my senior project and an
incomplete but usable reference manual) and the source code (on 132
character wide green bar paper came to light, so now I'm going to type
it all in again, for posterity.
