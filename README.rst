VTIL - VAX Threaded Interpretive Language
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

My undergrad senior project at the tail end of the 1980s was writing a
Threaded Interpretive Language for VAX/VMS, which I named VTIL.  I
wrote it in VAX MACRO using subroutine threading, and enjoyed the
process immensely.

Eventually I didn't have access to the tape drives necessary to get
the source off tape anymore, and then the tapes disappeared for good.

However, recently printouts of the documentation (the paper I wrote
for my senior project and an incomplete but usable reference manual)
and the source code (on 132 character wide green bar paper; such
nostalgia!) came to light, so now I'm going to type it all in again,
for posterity.
